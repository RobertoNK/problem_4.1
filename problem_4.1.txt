BOOK: JAVA PROGRAMMING FROM THE BEGINNING 


Make the following changes to the CourseAverage program(
section 2.11)

(a) Have the user enter six quiz scores instead of five.
the revised program should drop the lowest when computing
the quiz average. Each time the user enters a new score, use
an if statement to compare it with the lowest score so far;
if the new score is lower, assign it to the "lowest score"
variable. After all the quiz scores have been read, subtract
the lowest score from the total. Extra credit: Write the
program without using an if statement. (Hint: use Math.min
mehtod)

(b) Use a loop to read and calculate the program total and
quiz total.
