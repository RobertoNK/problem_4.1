# problem_4.1
This program modifies the program introduced on section 2.11;  introduces a loop to collect input from the user, and then uses an if statement to determine the lowest quiz score entered so far, and finally calculates the average. On part b,  uses Math.min(a,b) method instead of an if statement to record the lowest grade.
